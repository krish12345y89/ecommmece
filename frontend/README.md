# E-commerce Frontend

This is a minimal React frontend for the e-commerce project.

Setup

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend expects the backend API to be available at `/api` (same origin). When developing locally, you can run the backend on `http://localhost:5000` and configure a proxy in `package.json` or use a reverse proxy.
